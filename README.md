# heart-disease-prediction
In this project, we used the 'heart.csv' dataset to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on various features.
We first loaded the dataset and found the minimum and maximum values for each feature. We then built an SVM model using default parameter values and evaluated its performance using the hold-out method. We found that the accuracy was not sufficient, and related this to the difference in minimum and maximum values between the training and test sets. To improve the performance, we rescaled the data using MinMaxScaler and rebuilt the SVM model. We found that rescaling improved the accuracy of the model. We then optimized the SVM model using GridSearchCV with k=10, and split the data into training, validation, and test sets. We found the best parameters for the model and rebuilt it with those parameters. We found that optimization improved the model's performance.
